## Trees

Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for Tree:

### sumValues
Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the sum of all the integers.

### countEvens
Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the count of all the even integers.

### numGreater
Given a n-ary tree and a number x, find and return the number of nodes which are greater than x.

## Binary Trees
Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for BinaryTree:

### minDepth
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### maxDepth
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### maxSum
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.

### nextLarger
Given a binary tree and a integer x. Find and return the value of the node with next larger element in the tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than x. Return null if no node is present with value greater than x.
